# PcaNet applied to face classification

We implemented the PCA network described in following reference:

> *PCANet: A Simple Deep Learning Baseline for Image Classification?*, Tsung-Han Chan, Kui Jia, Shenghua Gao, Jiwen Lu, Zinan Zeng, and Yi Ma, 2014

We evaluated the PcaNet model on Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset using an SVM as a classifier.

## Summary of the method

PcaNet is a model which compute a **cascade of convolutions**.
